My Strategic Plan for Narrative News Project

  Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1-2)

  Goal: Get a working local environment

  1. Project Initialization
    - Create fresh Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
    - Copy artifacts into proper directory structure
    - Merge the two package.json files intelligently
    - Set up Git with proper .gitignore
  2. Environment & Config
    - Create .env.local with ALL variables
    - Build environment validation schema (using Zod)
    - Add fallbacks for missing configs
    - Create development-friendly defaults
  3. Database Setup
    - Convert prisma_schema.txt → schema.prisma
    - Set up local PostgreSQL (or use Supabase free tier)
    - Run migrations
    - Test connection with health check

  Phase 2: Core Systems (Day 3-4)

  Goal: Make the dangerous stuff safe

  4. Authentication Layer
    - Implement NextAuth.js for admin routes
    - Add middleware to protect /admin/*
    - Create simple email/password auth (can upgrade later)
    - Session management
  5. Job Queue System
    - Add BullMQ for background jobs
    - Move AI analysis to queue
    - Move scraping to queue
    - Add retry logic and error handling
  6. API Architecture
    - Place API routes in /app/api/* structure
    - Add global error handling
    - Implement proper rate limiting
    - Add request validation

  Phase 3: Feature Assembly (Day 5-6)

  Goal: Get features working

  7. Frontend Routes
    - Set up /app directory pages
    - Connect components to API routes
    - Add loading states and error boundaries
    - Implement client-side data fetching
  8. Background Services
    - Set up cron jobs properly
    - Test automation pipeline
    - Add monitoring for failed jobs
    - Implement graceful shutdowns

  Phase 4: Production Ready (Day 7)

  Goal: Deployable and maintainable

  9. Deployment Prep
    - Docker setup that actually works
    - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
    - Environment-specific configs
    - Database backup strategy
  10. Monitoring & Operations
    - Error tracking (Sentry)
    - Logging strategy
    - Health endpoints
    - Performance monitoring

  My Recommended Tech Decisions:

  Simplifications to avoid headaches:
  - Database: Use Supabase (free PostgreSQL + built-in auth)
  - Queue: Use Vercel's built-in cron + serverless functions (simpler than
  BullMQ)
  - Email: SendGrid API instead of SMTP
  - Auth: Clerk or Supabase Auth (faster than building)
  - Deployment: Vercel (handles everything automatically)

  Critical Success Factors:
  1. Start with working demo - Get homepage + 1 API route working first
  2. Test deployments early - Deploy to Vercel on Day 2, not Day 7
  3. Use managed services - Don't self-host anything initially
  4. Progressive enhancement - Basic version first, fancy features later
  5. Keep artifacts organized - Version control everything

  Immediate Next Steps:

  1. Create the actual Next.js project structure
  2. Set up environment with sane defaults
  3. Get one complete flow working (homepage → article → API)
  4. Deploy that minimal version
  5. Then add complexity
