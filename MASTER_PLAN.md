- RSS feed scraping & content extraction
- Story matching algorithm (left vs right sources)
- AI-powered bias analysis (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Dual perspective article database
- Admin dashboard framework
- Newsletter system
- API routes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gaps for production:**
- Authentication system (critical)
- PostgreSQL migration (currently SQLite)
- Automated cron scheduling
- Testing infrastructure
- Performance optimizations
- Revenue features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### If Starting Fresh:
1. Read this MASTER_PLAN.md
2. Start with [SECTION1.md](./SECTION1.md)
3. Follow sections in order (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6)

### If Continuing:
1. Check section status above
2. Open the relevant SECTION{N}.md file
3. Follow the task checklist
4. Mark tasks complete as you go

### If Deploying Soon:
1. Complete Section 1 & 2 (CRITICAL)
2. Deploy to production
3. Return to Section 3-6 for improvements

---

## üí° Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why This Order?

**Section 1 First:** Documentation establishes shared understanding
**Section 2 Critical:** Can't deploy without auth & production DB
**Section 3 Before 4:** Test infrastructure before optimization
**Sections 4-5 Flexible:** Can be done in parallel or swapped
**Section 6 Last:** Build audience before monetizing

### What's Different from HTML Roadmap?

The HTML roadmap was aspirational. This master plan is:
- ‚úÖ Based on actual codebase analysis
- ‚úÖ Focused on real gaps (not already-built features)
- ‚úÖ Prioritized by production needs (not feature wishlist)
- ‚úÖ Realistic time estimates
- ‚úÖ Pragmatic approach

### Key Insights:

1. **Your codebase is 75% complete** - Core features already work!
2. **Main gap is infrastructure** - Auth, testing, production config
3. **Don't over-engineer** - Simple solutions first, optimize later
4. **Monetize after launch** - Get users first, revenue follows
