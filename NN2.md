# Narrative News 2.0: Implementation Plan
## Institutional Memory & Historical Context System

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Transform Narrative News from "side-by-side comparison" to **"side-by-side comparison + institutional memory"** by adding historical context and pattern recognition to every article.

**Core Innovation:** Track what politicians/media promised vs. what actually happened, then surface relevant patterns when analyzing new stories.

**Target Audience:** The 80% in the middle who are tired of being gaslit and want to learn from history.

## üìê Architecture Overview

### **Current Structure (What We Have)**
```
Article {
  id
  title
  category
  publishedAt
  leftSource: NewsSource
  rightSource: NewsSource
  aiAnalysis: string | EnhancedAnalysis
}

EnhancedAnalysis {
  summary: string
  truthCheck?: string
  spinDetection?: string
  realImpact?: string
  commonGround?: string
  biggerPicture?: string
}
```

### **Proposed Structure (What We're Adding)**
```typescript
Article {
  id
  title
  category
  publishedAt
  leftSource: NewsSource
  rightSource: NewsSource
  aiAnalysis: EnhancedAnalysis
  historicalContext?: HistoricalContext  // NEW
}

HistoricalContext {
  topic: string

  whatToWatch: WatchPoint[]
}

Precedent {
  event: string
  date: string
  promises: Claim[]
  outcomes: Outcome[]
  timeframe: string

#### 3.2 Update Article Detail Page

**File:** `/app/article/[id]/page.tsx`

Add after Truth & Impact section:

```typescript
{/* Historical Context Section */}
{article.historicalContext && (
  <HistoricalContext
    topic={article.historicalContext.topic}
    precedents={article.historicalContext.precedents}
    patterns={article.historicalContext.patterns}
    watchPoints={article.historicalContext.watchPoints}
  />
)}
```

### **Phase 4: Content Creation Workflow** (Week 4-5)

#### 4.1 AI Prompt Engineering

**File:** `/lib/services/ai-prompts.ts`

```typescript
export const HISTORICAL_CONTEXT_PROMPT = `
You are a historical analyst for Narrative News, serving the 80% in the middle who want facts over spin.

Given a news story about: {topic}

Task: Research and provide historical context following this structure:

1. IDENTIFY RELEVANT PRECEDENTS
   - Find 2-3 similar events/policies from history
   - Focus on the last 20 years for relevance
   - Include: What was promised, what actually happened, timeframe

2. RECOGNIZE PATTERNS
   - What patterns does this follow?
   - How reliable is this pattern historically?
   - Examples that prove the pattern

3. TRACK RECORDS
   - Who made predictions about similar situations?
   - Were they right or wrong?
   - Evidence and sources

4. WHAT TO WATCH FOR
   - Based on patterns, what should we monitor?
   - How will we know who was right (in 6-12 months)?
   - What are the key indicators?

GUIDELINES:
- Use only verifiable historical facts with sources
- No speculation, only documented outcomes
- Include both successful and failed predictions from all sides
- Focus on outcomes, not intentions
- Be specific with numbers and timeframes
- Cite sources

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON matching the HistoricalContext interface
`;
```

#### 4.2 Manual Curation Process

**File:** `/docs/CURATION_PROCESS.md`

```markdown
# Historical Context Curation Process

## For Each New Article:

### Step 1: Identify Topic Category
- Climate/Environment
- Economy/Taxes
- Healthcare
- Foreign Policy
- Regulation
- etc.

### Step 2: Search Pattern Library
Check `/lib/historical-patterns/` for relevant patterns:
- Do any existing patterns apply?
- What's the reliability score?
- Are the examples still relevant?

### Step 3: Find Precedents
Research similar situations:
- Last 5-20 years for relevance
- Focus on verifiable outcomes
- Document sources

### Step 4: Create Watch Points
Define success criteria:
- What would prove each side right?
- What metrics can we track?
- When should we check back?

### Step 5: Review & Edit
- Fact-check all claims
- Verify all sources
- Remove speculation
- Ensure balance (call out both sides equally)

### Step 6: Add to Database
Use admin interface or direct Prisma:
```typescript
await prisma.historicalContext.create({
  data: {
    articleId: "...",
    topic: "...",
    precedents: { create: [...] },
    patterns: { create: [...] },
    watchPoints: { create: [...] }
  }
})
```
```

---

### **Phase 5: Admin Interface** (Week 5-6)

#### 5.1 Pattern Management UI

**File:** `/app/admin/patterns/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Admin page to:
// - View all patterns
// - Add new patterns
// - Edit reliability scores
// - Mark patterns as outdated
// - See which articles use each pattern
```

#### 5.2 Precedent Database UI

**File:** `/app/admin/precedents/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Admin page to:
// - Browse all precedents
// - Add new precedents
// - Update outcomes as they evolve
// - Link precedents to articles
// - Track source citations
```

#### 5.3 Article Historical Context Editor

**File:** `/app/admin/articles/[id]/historical-context/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Form to add/edit historical context for an article:
// - Select relevant patterns from library
// - Add custom precedents
// - Define watch points
// - Preview how it renders
// - Save/publish
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **User Engagement**
- Time on article page (expect +30-50% with historical context)
- Scroll depth (track if users reach historical section)
- Return visits (users coming back to check "What to Watch For")

### **Content Quality**
- Number of precedents per article (target: 2-3)
- Source citation completeness (target: 100%)
- Historical accuracy (fact-check quarterly)

### **Competitive Differentiation**
- Unique feature (no competitor has systematic institutional memory)
- SEO value ("What happened after Kyoto Protocol" searches)
- Share-ability (historical sections are highly shareable)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### **Accuracy Risk**
- **Problem:** Historical facts must be 100% accurate or we lose credibility
- **Mitigation:**
  - All precedents require 2+ sources
  - Quarterly fact-check review
  - User-submitted corrections process
  - "Last verified: [date]" on each precedent

### **Bias Risk**
- **Problem:** Selection of which precedents to include could show bias
- **Mitigation:**
  - Include both successful and failed predictions from all sides
  - Pattern library reviewed by political diversity team
  - Transparent methodology page

### **Scope Creep Risk**
- **Problem:** Could become overwhelming to research every article
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with major stories only
  - Build library over time‚Äîreuse patterns
  - AI-assisted first draft, human review/edit
  - Not every article needs historical context

### **Maintenance Risk**
- **Problem:** Outcomes change over time, need updates
- **Mitigation:**
  - "Check back on [date]" reminders
  - Community flagging system
  - Annual review of evergreen precedents

---

## ‚ùì Open Questions for Review

1. **Scope:** Start with climate + economy only, or all categories?
2. **Depth:** How many precedents per article? (I recommend 2-3 max)
3. **Automation:** How much AI vs. manual curation? (I recommend AI draft, human verify)
4. **Community:** Allow user-submitted precedents? (Not in v1, maybe v2)
5. **Monetization:** Could historical database be a paid product later?

---

## ‚úÖ Decision Points

Before proceeding, need decisions on:

- [ ] Approve database schema
- [ ] Confirm pattern library structure
- [ ] Define content curation workflow
- [ ] Set quality standards (sources required, etc.)
- [ ] Determine launch timeline
- [ ] Allocate resources (dev time, research time)

---

**Next Step:** Review this plan, provide feedback, then I'll implement Phase 1 (database schema + infrastructure).
